    "## Introduction:\n",
    "As a major automobile producer, the economic development of many regions in the United States largely depends on the automobile industry. For example, in Detroit, auto workers once became synonymous with the city, and car production depends to some extent on sales volume. Only with sufficient sales volume can economic activities such as car production continue without causing layoffs. As an automobile company, it is essential to analyze the possible sales volume in the future to adopt the production work policy for the next quarter. But with the outbreak of the 2020 Covid epidemic in the United States, social distancing and remote work policies may greatly affect people's going out and the demand for cars. On the other hand, for many people who took public transportation before the epidemic, the fear of infection due to social distancing has also increased their demand for cars. This makes the analysis of the data with great uncertainty. So in our study, we tried to understand whether there was a close relationship between the severity of the outbreak (the daily coronavirus cases in the US) and car purchases in the US. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior Work:\n",
    "We chose a few similar works conducted related to the relationship between the car market and Covid-19’s impact. One study indicated that due to avoiding mass transportation, Covid-19 has led to an increase in used car sales.According to his point of view, car sales in the early stage of the epidemic have dropped significantly, but with the re-influence of Delta and omicron, people's demand for private transportation travel will rise again. It is expected that the sales volume that has dropped sharply in the early stage of the epidemic due to remote working, keeping social distance and other policies will pick up again, that is, the decrease in the number of infected people may lead to an increase in car sales. In another study focused on the saling cases of auto industries during pandemic, the researchers compared the data of the car manufacturers before and after the pandemic and drew the conclusion that the car manufacturers faced disruption in business areas and had trouble with remote saling patterns during the pandemic.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "According to the prior works we found, we noticed that a larger number of researchers concluded that the pandemic has a positive relationship with the decrease of car sales compared to the opposite opinion.  Thus, we decided that though there are many elements affecting the number of car sales, we can hypothesize that there is a relationship between the increase of coronavirus disease cases and the decrease of car purchases in the US.\n",

The research and data we found in the related works also support our hypothesis.\n"

In addition, we make sure that all datasets are collected with informed consent, meaning that all observations are aware that they’re being sampled. \n",
